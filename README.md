## Description
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

* I used ReactJs, Node JS, and Javascript
<br>
<br>

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
